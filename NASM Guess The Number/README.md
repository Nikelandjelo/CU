Using Assembly, create a program that asks questions to attempt to guess a number picked by the user. It can do this by asking if the users number is **higher** or **lower** than one suggested by the game.

```
For example: If the user picked 42, the output could be something like

GAME: Is The Number Higher than 20
USER: Yes

GAME: Is the Number Higher than 50
USER: No

GAME: Is the Number Lower than 40:
USER: No
```

Submission Requirements:

- Assembly Code for the task
- Demonstration of one game being played (a screenshot is sufficient, and ascii-cast would be better)
