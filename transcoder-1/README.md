Transcoder is a tool for converting data from one format to
another. It's incomplete at the moment, so you will need to help
finish it.

You will need to learn a few things along the way, unless you know
them already. In particular, you will need:

 - Basic python
 - Virtual environments (venv)
 - PyDoc
 - PyTest
 - Basic Linux CLI
 - Data representation
 
# Introduction

This is a very simple tool, but it does (or will do) a few useful things.  

In cybersecurity, we often have to work with data in different
representations. For example, when creating payloads for exploits, we
might have to switch between bytes represented as their ASCII values
and their binary, decimal or hexadecimal (hex) representation.  For
example, the capital letter A has the ASCII code 65.  65 in hex
is 41. In octal it is 101, and in binary it is 01000001.


# Completing Transcoder

TODO:

  Done - asASCII (basic)
  Done - User input (intermediate)
  Done - wrapping (advanced)

# TODO - things left to do before students get access

 - Clear up TODO items
 - Write bit about cloning repo

P.S. The transcoder use list of strings instead of only string, so I added lists into the test script. Please, use the test script of this specific repo for testing.
